# v1.0.0
Initial release, yes it's `1.0.0`, not `0.0.1` as you like to do

Comes with:
* `block` function to produce components namespace and all related elements
* `applyModifiers` function for advanced bem modifiers usage

****

**TODO**
- [ ] add mixed modifiers functionality
- [ ] more tests
- [ ] split tests into modules
